A **SRS (Spaced Repetition System)** application to help you memorise key elements of programming languages.  

## 📄 Overview

`srs_app` is a simple command-line/interactive tool written in Python that allows you to create, store, and review “flashcards” (questions/answers) so that you can memorise syntax or concepts of programming languages (or anything else). It uses spaced-repetition principles to schedule reviews for optimal long-term retention.
